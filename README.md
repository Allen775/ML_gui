# ML_gui

brain age prediction model GUI.
1. model_trainer should be replaced with your model training .py file. In val_test_gui.py import this file and alter the training fuction.
2. prediction model should be replaced with model test .py file.
3. brain_age_utils.ipynb contains basic function that implement in GUI.
4. Since I use ipywidget modual, the GUI must run by run_model.ipynb.
